## General Information

- It was understood that since virtual learning has become the new norm, from
preschool to higher education, the majority of the community has become familiar
with online learning platforms and comfortable in learning through online video
conferencing tools.However, one major issue that can be seen in the online education domain is that
students easily get distracted by other applications, social media and websites on
their devices. This has led to students not reaping the maximum benefit of online
tutoring sessions. Existing virtual platforms do not offer any solution to track if
students are actually paying attention to the lessons or if they have got distracted by
any other applications while listening to the lecture.


- There are many platforms already in the market which offer online courses and
platforms which conduct live online classes. Although there are a lot of pros of online
teaching platforms, there are many drawbacks that have not been addressed to
improve the quality of online education. One major issue that can be seen is the
communication gap between the tutors and students. Usually, the student attends
the online classes but there is no proper feedback loop to evaluate the student
engagement, existing in most of the online education platforms.


- One of the biggest reasons for us to initiate this project is to uplift the education
industry of Sri Lanka, which affected massively during the covid-19 and the recent
difficulties faced in the transportation industry. As responsible undergraduates of
University of Colombo School of Computing, we thought of initializing such a project
for the betterment of school children’s education considering our members’ capacity.
